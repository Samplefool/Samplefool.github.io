  ve been in the Army for 16 years and I served as Maintenance Soldier, NCO, and currently Warrant Officer. I have a critical sense of attention to detail, and I am well adapted to management of projects and personnel. I enjoy working as a team to accomplish a shared objective. My skills include ESRI products, Google Earth Engine, R Studio and Microsoft suite tools. My undergraduate degree is environmental management with an emphasis in disaster management.
